    <p class="content">Well, two people have been arrested in Tamil Nadu for allegedly selling Kauwa Biryani instead of chicken. The love for biryani is fading away in India. This was not a one-time thing, but a planned business idea. The two arrested had been intoxicating crows at all local temple, feeding them rice.</p>

    <p class="content">Dolma aunty's momos have a thin dough for Momo's and filling is more than just cabbage. I do like her Momos but the chutney can be more spicy.

 <p class="content">This fresh strawberry cream cake roll is filled with a fresh whipped cream that is stabilized with gelatin. For cake rolls, I prefer taking some extra steps to stabilize the cream filling because whipped cream has a tendency to deflate after a while.</p>
